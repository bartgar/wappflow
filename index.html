          <h3>What is wappflow?</h3>

            <p>To put it simply, it is a general workflow for new web application projects. Often there is a great deal of confusion about how a new project should be handled, which groups of work are involved, and what order they should be done in.</p>

            <p>wappflow is a basic, bird's-eye-view of the process, that can apply to virtually any new web project. It focuses on the different types of requirements, and shows clearly who should be in charge of them.</p>

            <h3>The presentation.</h3>

            <p>The <a href="./presentation">presentation</a> is designed to give your business or team a general overview of the wappflow process, so that everyone has an understanding of how requirements drive the decision making, and how the resulting product can and will facilitate the needs of all parties involved.</p>

            <h3>It's missing something!</h3>

            <p>Again, this is a high-level overview of the different types of work. We want this to be generic enough that it can fit any size of business. For example, sometimes Development will also maintain testing, and/or content entry. Sometimes Design and Development will be conducted by the same team. This doesn't change the fact that they are different bodies of work, basing decisions off of functional & technical requirements.</p>

            <h3>Want more?</h3>

            <p>Please send any comments or suggestions to me, so that I can continue to refine the presentation.</p>
